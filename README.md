# Cyptocurrency_project


## Database
We present the mockup database using a SQL-based database, including an ERD of the database. 
### SQL
In SQL, we imported BTC.csv which includes crypto currency daily price change and the data for social media feeds volume and score for discussion of specifying cryptocurrency from Python. In the dataset, timestamp info is transferred to DateTime data for further comparison with other cryptocurrencies. After the import, we have performed the completeness check over the imported data from python with no variance noted.


### ERD
We have 1 dataset that includes cryptocurrency daily price change and the data for social media feeds volume and score. For the purpose of the mockup database, we use Bitcoin to analyze the trend between social media feeds and the time series model to analyze the potential fluctuations of the currency. In the next module, we will be using other cryptocurrency and we will use the dates as a key to merge different currency and to analyze there is an impact when other currencies has high discussion threads.
