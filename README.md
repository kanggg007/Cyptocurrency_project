# Cyptocurrency_project


## Database
We present the mockup database using a SQL-based database, including an ERD of the database. 
### SQL
In SQL, we imported BTC.csv which includes crypto currency daily price change and the data for social media feeds volumn and score for discussion of specify cryptocurrency from Python. In the dataset, timestamp info is transferred to datetime data for further comparison with other cryptocurrency. After the import, we have performed the completeness check over the imported data from python with no variance noted.


### ERD
We have 1 dataset includes cryptocurrency daily price change and the data for social media feeds volumn and score. For the purpose of the mockup database, we use Bitcoin to analyze the trend between social media feeds and time series model to analyze the potential flucatuation of the currency. In the next module, we will be using other cryptocurrency and we will use the date as a key to merge differenct currency and to analyze there is a impact when other currency has high discussion threads.
